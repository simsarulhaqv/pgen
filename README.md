Problem Statement -- 
Quantum computers can solve problems that classical computers need intractable resources. With the limited logical qubits available for practical use, it is necessary or important in the near term to have an optimized quantum algorithm that makes the best use of available logical qubits and make a valuable real world outcome.

Why agents? -- 
Agents turn quantum algorithms into self-optimizing systems that adapt to noise, hardware, and problem structures — delivering faster convergence, higher fidelity, and practical quantum value.

With Agents, quantum algorithms can be optimized. This can be achieved through following means:

Automated Quantum Circuit Search & Design
*Agents can automatically explore thousands of quantum circuit architectures and parameter settings.

Instead of a human manually tweaking gates, an agent evaluates performance metrics (fidelity, depth, noise) and iteratively proposes better circuits.

Outcome: Lower-depth circuits, reduced decoherence, faster run times → higher fidelity on real NISQ devices.*

Noise-Aware Adaptive Optimization
*Quantum algorithms behave differently depending on noise profiles of specific hardware.

Agents can monitor real-time hardware calibration data and dynamically adjust circuits, qubit mappings, error mitigation techniques.

Outcome: Algorithms that self-adapt to each machine’s imperfections → practical quantum advantage window opens sooner.*

Hybrid Quantum-Classical Feedback Loops
*Most useful quantum algorithms today (VQE, QAOA, QML) are hybrid loops.

Agents can manage this loop intelligently: tuning parameters, early-stopping, exploring new configurations, and pruning bad paths.

Outcome: 5–20x faster convergence and significantly lower compute cost.*

Agentic RAG for Quantum Knowledge
*Agents can continuously ingest new quantum research (papers, arXiv, GitHub) and apply insights to improve algorithms.

They act as a “brain” that updates quantum workflows using the ansatz ideas, Hamiltonian decomposition tricks, compression techniques

Outcome: Always-up-to-date quantum algorithms without human manual research.*

Real-Time Decision Making for Quantum-AI Hybrid Pipelines
*For quantum machine learning pipelines, agents can route tasks between classical GPUs and quantum hardware and also decide what computation should be offloaded

Outcome: Better throughput and cost efficiency without human tuning.*
